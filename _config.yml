# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to "Full Stack, Full Beard" — a collection of development blogs by Gazza, the bearded coder on a mission to demystify code, share quirky insights, and sprinkle a little humor (and beard wisdom) into your dev journey. Whether you’re debugging at dawn or deploying after dark, you’ll find tutorials, hot takes, and beard-powered programming stories right here. Coding never looked so hairy — or so much fun!
